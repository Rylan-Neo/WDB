            <h2 class="headerfont">Week 7</h2>
            <p>In week 7, I somewhat learnt about local storage.</p>
            <p>It's about storing data values for users on the browser</p>
            <p>It has its limits, and it is different from sessions that require cookies</p>

            <p>In week 8, I learnt about API and AJaX</p>
            <p>These were incredibly complex, but I somewhat understood its function</p>
            <p>It makes sending requests and recieving data much faster, and also handles storing of data differently.</p>

            <p>But I really didn't have the time to test out stuff on my own and practise D: </p>
